## Save bank

I think you know what a save bank is.

Each save in save bank is an object like this:
```js
{
  name: "blah",
  saveCode: "code"
}
```

Individual saves can use these features:

- name: short desctiption of the save like "10 boosters". This appears on the button

- saveCode: string containing the save to be imported. Just export your save and copy paste there.
